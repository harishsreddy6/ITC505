        <h2>Lights Out Tutorial</h2>
        <p>
            LightsOut is a puzzle where you are given a grid of cells, or lights, with some dark and others light. 
            You must turn them all off by clicking on the cells. Each click toggles that cell and each of its immediate neighbors.
        </p>
        <h3>How To Solve LightsOut Puzzles</h3>
        <p>
            All valid LightsOut puzzles can be solved without clicking on any cell twice. This is because clicking on a cell twice 
            is the same as not clicking it at all.
        </p>
        <h4>Chase The Lights</h4>
        <p>
            The easiest way to solve LightsOut puzzles is to use a method called "Chase The Lights". Starting with the second row, 
            click on every cell that has a light on in the row above it. This will turn off all the lights in that row. 
            Continue with each successive row until the only remaining lights are in the final row.
        </p>
        <h4>Fewest Moves</h4>
        <p>
            To figure out the fewest possible moves, take the click pattern for the top row and start with that on the original puzzle. 
            This time you will only need to chase the lights once.

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            This project was designed to create a dynamic Lights Out game with additional features like tracking time, target moves, 
            and best scores. The process involved designing a grid-based game with CSS Grid for flexibility and adding JavaScript 
            logic for toggling cells and checking the winning condition. Challenges like creating a random but solvable board and 
            implementing a timer were overcome using simulation methods and careful planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The timer was implemented using JavaScript's setInterval method, and the best score logic was stored in the browser's 
            localStorage for persistence. The game's visual appeal was enhanced with kid-friendly colors and animations, ensuring 
            an engaging experience for younger audiences.
