        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Machine learning techniques are increasingly being utilized to predict lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and hypertension early on. This paper presents a comprehensive data-driven approach to leverage machine learning algorithms for early diagnosis, focusing on real-world datasets and predictive model efficiency.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            With the rise in lifestyle diseases globally, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions to tackle this challenge. This paper investigates the potential of machine learning in healthcare, particularly for early diagnosis of lifestyle diseases.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            The methodology involves the collection of healthcare data from various sources, pre-processing techniques to clean and prepare the data, and the application of machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The results from the study indicate a high degree of accuracy in predicting diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, with Neural Networks showing the highest predictive performance.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The paper concludes that machine learning is a promising tool for the early prediction of lifestyle diseases, offering the potential to significantly improve healthcare outcomes.

        <h2>Stylistic Choices</h2>
        
        <h3>Font Choices</h3>
        <p>
            For the main text, I chose <strong>Lora</strong>, a serif font, to create an academic feel that aligns with the formal nature of the essay. For the headers, I used <strong>Montserrat</strong>, a clean sans-serif font, to add contrast and improve readability.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Font Sizes</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>h1</code> header is sized at <strong>2.5em</strong> (up to <strong>3em</strong> on larger screens) for immediate visual impact. <code>h2</code> headers are sized at <strong>1.8em</strong> to distinguish them from the main text while keeping them noticeable but not overpowering. The main body text is set to <strong>1.1em</strong> to maintain readability without overwhelming the viewer with large chunks of text.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Color Choices</h3>
        <p>
            A soft blue (<strong>#4A90E2</strong>) was selected for the headers and link hover states to create a sense of calmness and professionalism. It contrasts well with the light background color. The background color for the entire page is a light gray (<strong>#f9f9f9</strong>), which is easy on the eyes, with white sections for the main article and header to create distinct content areas. The text color is a dark gray (<strong>#333333</strong>) for readability, contrasted with lighter gray (<strong>#555555</strong>) for footer text.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Margins and Padding</h3>
        <p>
            The layout uses generous padding around the header and article sections for a spacious and open feel. Margin adjustments for the headings, paragraphs, and list items help keep the layout consistent and visually balanced.
        </p>
        
        <h3>HTML Abuse Adjustments</h3>
        <p>
            The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag was used as the title's highest-level heading to establish proper document hierarchy, instead of previously using a lower-level heading tag solely for visual effect.
        </p>

    <!-- Footer with last updated script -->
    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: <span id="lastModified"></span></p>
    </footer>
    
    <!-- Script to show the last modified date of the webpage -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</body>
